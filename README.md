# Wyscout-Data-Wrangling

*clubelo_plugin.R* is a script for augmenting a dataset containing team names with ELO team ratings from today's http://clubelo.com/API
The following columns are added:
- ELO rating for the team in question
- Average ELO rating for all of that team's domestic league opponents (as a measure of strength of schedule across the season)
- Team ELO rating - Average domestic oppoisition ELO rating (as a measure of relative ease of eaverage fixture)

**The file path to the dataset to be augmented in .xlsx format must be given at the first argument to the function call.**

ClubElo uses abbreviated team names in their dataset, so clubelo_plugin.R must reference a look-up table to match team names as they appear on ClubElo to the corresponding names as they appear in the original dataset. One such look-up table for matching against Wyscout team names is found at *team_names.csv*. **The file path to the lookup table must be given as the second argument to the function call.**

**The path to save the augmented data to must be given as the third and final argument to the function call** (without file suffix - the resultant file is automatically an Excel_csv file).

**EXAMPLE FUNCTION CALL:**
clubelo_plugin("C:/Users/me/Documents/wyscout_data.xlsx", 
"C:/Users/me/Documents/team_names.csv",
"C:/Users/me/Documents/wyscout_data_mod")
